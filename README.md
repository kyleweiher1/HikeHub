# HikeHubV2
## Project Description

HikeHubV2 is a SwiftUI-based iOS app that helps users find nearby parks and hiking trails. The app displays a map with annotations of nearby parks and allows users to search for parks and save their favorite trails.

## Features: 
  1. Interactive map with park annotations
  2. Search functionality for parks
  3. Displays list of saved trails
  4. View nearby parks with detailed information
  5. Easy access to saved trails from the main view
## Usage:
  1. Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a welcome message and a search bar to find parks. The main screen features an interactive map that      displays nearby parks as annotations.

## At the bottom of the main screen, there are two buttons:

#### Parks Near Me: Displays a list of nearby parks along with detailed information about each park.
#### Saved Trails: Shows a list of user's saved trails.

    - Clicking on either button will bring up a new screen with the corresponding content.

### Outstanding Features & Improvements:

While HikeHubV2 is a great starting point, there are some outstanding features and improvements that can be made to enhance the app's functionality and user experience:

### 1. Fix Search Functionality:
The search bar is currently not functioning properly. Implementing a working search functionality will allow users to easily find parks and trails by name or location. This can be achieved by integrating with a third-party API or creating a custom search algorithm.

### 2. Implement Local Database for Saved Trails:
The "Saved Trails" feature currently does not persist data across app launches. Implementing a local database, such as CoreData or SQLite, will enable users to save their favorite trails and access them even after closing and reopening the app. This will improve the overall user experience by providing a more personalized and engaging experience.

### 3. Trail Details and Ratings:
Enhance the app by adding a feature that allows users to view detailed information about individual trails, such as difficulty level, distance, elevation gain, and user reviews. Additionally, integrating a rating system will allow users to provide feedback on trails and help others make informed decisions when choosing a trail to hike.

### 4. Offline Maps Support:
Adding offline maps support will enable users to access maps and trail information even when they do not have an active internet connection. This can be particularly useful for users who are hiking in remote areas with limited or no network coverage.

### 5. Social Features:
Integrate social features such as sharing trails with friends, following other users, and participating in community challenges. This will encourage user engagement and provide a more connected and interactive experience within the app.

By addressing these outstanding features and improvements, HikeHubV2 will be able to provide a more comprehensive and enjoyable experience for its users, making it a go-to app for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts.
